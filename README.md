## Project for Database Management System
### University Management System
First instal XAMPP for windows from https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html - XAMPP for Windows 7.3.4 (PHP 7.3.4).
Put the DBMS folder in htdocs in C:/xampp (or where ever you have installed it).
open phpmyadmin and import mydb.sql in mydb databse. 
Open localhost/DBMS. 
It will lead you to the login page. We have a common login page for faculty, students, dugc, staff and admin.
The database already has some entries.
You can login into admin by using the following credentials. 
username - admin
password - admin
From here you can see the login details of the other users or create your own.
You can also access the user_table from phpmyadmin and see the username and password of all users and login accordingly.
